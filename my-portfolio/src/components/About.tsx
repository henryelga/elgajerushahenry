      <p className="max-w-5xl mx-auto text-lg">
        Passionate and curious final-year Software Development student at
        Dundalk Institute of Technology, Ireland. <br />
        <br />I am committed to continuous learning and thrive in dynamic
        environments where I can develop new skills, tackle challenges and
        contribute meaningfully. <br />
        <br />
        My journey into software development began in 2020 when I taught myself
        Python through online courses. This sparked my passion for technology,
        led me to explore HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other tools. Now, as I
        enter my final year of study, I'm eager to refine my skills and take the
        next step toward becoming a well-rounded software developer. <br />
        <br />
        One way I keep my problem-solving skills sharp is by exploring different
        types of Rubik's Cubes. I'm self-taught and enjoy solving a variety of
        cubes like the 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, Mirror Cube, Skewb, Barrel Cube,
        Pyraminx, Gear Cube, and Megaminx. It's about breaking down complex
        problems into manageable steps, staying patient, and always looking for
        new approaches to challenges. <br />
        <br />
        Outside of coding and cubing, I enjoy playing music (piano, harmonica,
        ukulele), reading mystery, adventure, detective stories, as well as
        biographies and autobiographies, and staying active through badminton.
        <br />
        <br />
        Adaptable, collaborative, and always curiousâ€”I'm ready to take on new
        challenges and keep learning every day.
