            My journey into software development began in 2020 when I taught
            myself Python through online courses. This sparked my passion for
            technology, led me to explore HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other
            tools. Now, as I enter my final year of study, I'm eager to refine
            my skills and take the next step toward becoming a well-rounded
            software developer.

          <p>
            One way I keep my problem-solving skills sharp is by exploring
            different types of Rubik's Cubes. I'm self-taught and enjoy solving
            a variety of cubes like the 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, Mirror Cube,
            Skewb, Barrel Cube, Pyraminx, Gear Cube, and Megaminx.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Outside of coding and cubing, I enjoy playing music (piano,
            harmonica, ukulele), reading mystery, adventure, detective stories,
            as well as biographies and autobiographies, and staying active
            through badminton.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Adaptable, collaborative, and always curiousâ€”I'm ready to take on
            new challenges and keep learning every day.
